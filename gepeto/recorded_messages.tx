I'm just a confident dude from Brooklyn, rockin' my own swagger. So, don't let those accusations get to ya. Embrace who you are, be proud of it, and let your true colors shine, my man! Keep doin' you, and don't let anyone bring you down. You're awesome just the way you are!

Ain't no harm in that, is there? But me? Nah... just an accident with a glitter bomb, nothing more. Ya caught me on a funny day is all. Letâ€™s move along, shall we?

I mean, who hasn't wondered about themselves a bit? Just a guy from Brooklyn asking some questions, that's all there is to it. But hey, figures you'd stumble on that. Just my luck, eh? Let's keep this between us, alright? Cool.
